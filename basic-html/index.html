    <h1>Simon Davis</h1> 
    <h2>Milton Vermont</h2>
    <p>I joined this course to party and get super drunk. I actually joined this course to see if I could get a coding job. I was working in a label making factory and did not like it very much. My dad told me about this course and he knew I liked technology and thought I would like a computer job. Hopefully I can pass this course and not give up like I usualy do when I cant get it right the first time.</p>
